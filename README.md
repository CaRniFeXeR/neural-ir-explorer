The content-focused Neural-IR-Explorer empowers users to browse through neural re-ranking results and inspect the inner workings and fine-grained results of neural re-ranking models. We aim to explore the reasons behind ranking results.

The explorer includes a categorized overview of the available queries, as well as an individual query result view with various options to highlight semantic connections between query-document pairs.

## Dependency on neural re-ranking results

TODO - We will add a reference to our neural library as soon as it is public
